<h1 class="title">RBY Openings Guide</h1>
<div id="toc"></div>
<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

<p>
Since the paraslam changes the metagame has evolved a lot; specifically the way to handle status (and sleep in particular) has seen a very significant shift. This guide attempts to present a full picture of where we are today, highlighting successful team structures and opening strategies throughout post-paraslam history.
</p>

<p>
This guide is aimed at intermediate players, but I believe that even the top players should be able to take something away from it. A lot of what is discussed here is probably a slight bit beyond the capabilities of a completely new player, because it assumes that readers have a certain baseline amount of knowledge about what each pokemon can and can't do.
</p>

<h1 id="big4">2016-2018: Trading Thunder Waves Turn 1, and the 'big 4' meta</h1>
<p>
When paraslam was found, the first solid team structure that was found to dominate everything featured a lead (Alakazam or Starmie), the 'big 4' (Snorlax, Tauros, Chansey, and Exeggutor), and a flexible last slot. Paralyzing the enemy lead was great to enable pretty much all your pokemon to blow through them at a later stage, but people were also perfectly content to take paralysis on their lead because it allowed them to block Sleep Powders coming from Exeggutor, which was widely considered to be the best sleeper due to his ability to put heavy pressure on Reflect+Rest Snorlax, a pokemon that would otherwise dominate many early games. People also hesitated to drop Exeggutor because of his unique ability to switch in on Rhydon without suffering much, something that no pokemon in the tier can do as well as him.
</p>

<p>
Alternative structures and opening strategies did exist, but none were particularly successful. Jynx was present but <a href="https://www.pokemonperfect.com/forums/index.php?threads/jynx-in-rby-1u.5149/">vastly unsuccessful</a>; it would get sleep first, which was great, but it was such a terrible sleep block against Double-Edge or Hyper Beam Exeggutor. The Eggy teams would frequently manage to claim both the Jynx via normal moves, and a second pokemon via the Sleep Powder once the Jynx sleep block had gone, leaving Jynx users at a large disadvantage. When this didn't happen the Jynx users were mostly fine, but the winrates over a couple years showed that overall the match up was in Eggy's favor.
</p>

<p>
For a fairly long time, no one really found answers to this metagame. All the sleepers that weren't called Exeggutor were simply outperformed by Exeggutor. A lot of people tried to innovate in a lot of ways, but nothing stuck... then everything changed when the Wrap nation attacked.
</p>

<h1 id="victreebel"> 2018-2019: Victreebel makes everyone regret the day they were born </h1>

<p>
At some point players started realizing that Victreebel was very capable of taking over games against the typical 'big 4' structures. Since everyone just went along with allowing their lead eat paralysis and Chansey/Snorlax/Exeggutor are outsped by the demon plant, most teams did not have a lot of options against the fast Wrap and Sleep Powder. The last two slots would be Tauros, a pokemon that can deal with Victreebel but really hates being crippled by it, and a last slot that would determine the match up - while other Victreebel beaters such as Zapdos and Alakazam did exist, it was just as common (if not more common) to run Rhydon, Lapras, or Starmie, three options that fared much worse.
</p>

<p>
I want to specifically shoutout FOMG for spamming the fuck out of Victreebel at a high level and consolidating its viability at every stage of play; he ironed out the specifics of the Victreebel archetype, very often featuring Rhydon in the back for its ability to cover the Zapdos match up, and is overall unarguably the man who elevated Victreebel from 'a neat thing you can bring sometimes' to 'something I'm just going to bring almost every game and it's up to others to figure out how to beat this, because at the moment nothing does'.
</p>

<p>
With Victreebel storming into the scene we finally had found a sleeper that could perform on equal footing with Exeggutor; Eggy users were suffering and tired of getting 6-0'd in the builder whenever they loaded Starmie+big4+Rhydon into a Victreebel. Cursing the degeneracy of modern RBYers they started to look for countermeasures, and they were very successful.
</p>

<h1 id="sing"> 2019-2020: Sing Chansey to absorb the Turn 1 TWave </h1>

<p> Switching Chansey on Thunder Wave turn 1 was always a fringe line that had existed since 2016 and people were aware of; keeping the lead unparalyzed was powerful, and Chansey is even less susceptible to Exeggutor's breaking attempts than the typical Psychic-type leads. However often times the paralyzed Chansey would struggle to deal with an unending barrage of STAB Psychics between the crit rate and the drop rate, especially since the enemy lead wasn't paralyzed in this line, which made her chances even lower. </p>

<p> However, when looking for ways to deal with Victreebel, the idea of having an unparalyzed fast Psychic to switch into it looked particularly appealing, and so people started looking into this fringe line some more. Eventually it was figured out that if the Chansey carried Sing it would, in a large majority of cases, manage to sleep the Psychic-type before being forced out. This line was winning against BOTH Exeggutor and Victreebel, since Chansey would get an early sleep 'guaranteed' (bar rng tragedies) while Exeggutor would be unable to break through the paralyzed Chansey and Victreebel would be unable to break through the unparalyzed Psychic lead. </P.

<p> This line gained popularity and caused a long list of side effects due to how it alters traditional structures. All teams before this point had four slots pretty much forced: one for the sleeper (regardless of your choice of sleeper), and three for the Normals - which left only two slots for fillers. However, with the sleeper slot being compressed into the Normals, you now had three available slots, something that facilitated new cores a lot. Mons that did less role compression and more specific duties significantly improved in viability, because there were more slots to take up the duties which they failed to perform; picks like Gengar, Cloyster and Jolteon became much more popular as a result of this. Meanwhile picks that greatly enjoyed outspeeding the fast psychic leads due to paralysis had to deal with the reality of the fast psychic leads not being paralyzed nearly as often; Lapras and Victreebel in particular fell off a cliff, but mons such as Rhydon and Zapdos also suffered. </p>

<p> Eventually Exeggutor players adapted by simply not clicking Thunder Wave turn 1 anymore. Tossing out Psychics or even Blizzards to start the game off ensured that the opponent wouldn't get a sleep block, and even if sometimes they'd fall behind in tempo to a Sing Chansey that came in and got to sleep first, at least they didn't fall behind a full mon - they could just go to their sleeper at a later stage and pull the game back to an effective 5v5. Sing Chansey was still a winning match up into these sorts of ideas due to the fact it could get the Sleep quicker, also allowing the Sing Chansey user to start spreading paralysis quicker, but it is definitely a lot more playable if you are not a full mon down. </p>

<p> However, there was one Pokémon that had been waiting for a moment wheh the metagame would stop being so unfavourable for it. It was finally their time to shine: </p>

<h1 id="jynx"> 2019-2020: Jynx's resurgence </h1>

<p> The issue with Sing Chansey is that it forces the user to give up some very valuable moves on a Chansey. If it doesn't run Thunder Wave it struggles to shut down fast Psychics, Zapdos, and Tauros; if it doesn't run Counter it's heavily pressured by Snorlax. It also needs an attacking move to avoid being a complete sitting duck: Ice Beam is multipurpose, protecting against the many Ice-weak pokemon of the meta (Rhydon above all) while also pressuring Chansey with the freeze threat, but it leaves Chansey vulnerable to Psychic Starmie and absolutely toothless against Ice-types; Seismic Toss fares much better against these threats, but it gives serious Rhydon issues amongst other things. Eventually players settled on Sing + Ice Beam + Counter + the undroppable Soft-Boiled as the most common configuration, and I can't think of a much better set to allow Jynx to shine. </p>

<p> Jynx was FINALLY able to sleep block successfully, after years of being poor. Jynx can simply click Lovely Kiss turn 1 to claim the sleep first, and she gets a few chances to fish for a Blizzard freeze before being sent to bed herself - something that ultimately tips the odds in her favor in the match up. Her match up against Exeggutor was always a bit crappy but not completely unplayable, so when you add her favorable match ups against Sing Chansey to that fact, she becomes a very legitimate pick overall. </p>

<p> Although Jynx structures don't allow the full three mons of freedom that Sing Chansey can give, they can at least guarantee two unparalyzed mons in the back - something that couldn't happen in the Exeggutor era. This further enables picks like Jolteon, while also meaning that the role compressor gods of old such as Rhydon still have a place here. </p>

<h1 id="summary"> Summing up: A complete overview of today's most popular openings </h1>

<p> Attentive readers and expert RBYers will have figured out that these structures have a soft rock-paper-scissors type of mechanism going between them, revolving around the tempo that the different sleepers guarantee depending on the opening. None of the match ups are overwhelming, but traditional Eggy is slightly favored against Jynx, Jynx is slightly favored against Sing Chansey, and Sing Chansey is slightly favored against traditional Eggy. (Victreebel has all but disappeared due to its crushing negative match ups against both Jynx and Sing Chansey). Here are some guidelines about how to play all of these structures and openings; do note that planning anything accurately past the first handful of turns is incredibly difficult due to a few factors: the filler mons influence how you should play things, the RNG variance early on can influence how you should play things, and the number of possible scenarios to cover starts getting out of hand. I can only cover the first few turns, but having a good understanding of these turns can be a large upper hand against someone who does not go quite as deep. </p>

<h2 id="jynx"> Jynx </h2>

<img src="images/sprites/jynx.png">

<p> Eggy teams will want to Thunder Wave your Jynx and break her down with Eggy's normal moves to then Sleep Powder a pokemon once Jynx is down; you want to prevent this by either denying Exeggutor chances to switch in, or by securing a second sleep block before Jynx drops. </p>

<p> Sing Chansey teams will just want to sleep sack something and mirror the sleep ASAP; you have a small advantage from the odds of Blizzard freezing them before they can Sing, and a further advantage from the ability to wake Jynx on their Chansey later on, but that's some Grandmaster shit that's too deep even for this guide. </p>

<p> The non-Jynx players have the advantage of knowing the match up from turn 1 while you have to figure out if you are playing against Exeggutor or Sing Chansey; a preliminary guess can be hazarded by noticing if they Thunder Wave Jynx turn 1 or not. A Sing + IB Chansey player is the only player who wouldn't TWave the Jynx in most circumstances, since they want to avoid giving a powerful sleep block, however a turn 1 TWave isn't as conclusive of a result because it's a reasonable play for both Eggy and a Sing + SToss Chansey user; given the rarity of the set it is reasonable to assume that it's just an Eggy, but not certain. </p>

<p> If you don't get TWaved turn 1 you should assume Sing Chansey is about to switch in and try to match the sleep; you should most likely try to Blizz it on the switch in for maximum Freeze chances. However if you do get TWaved this both lowers the odds of a freeze landing and increases the odds of a second sleep block being desirable, which means going Tauros is very potent: if the sleeping pokemon stays in you get a free Body Slam, and if it switches out to Chansey you can lure the second Thunder Wave immediately. These early Tauros turns going well can be great equalizers in the slightly unfavorable Eggy match up, it's fairly important that you try to find them. </p>

<h2 id="eggy"> Exeggutor </h2>

<img src="images/sprites/exeggutor.png">

<p> Congratulations on choosing the least straightforward path to sleeping anything. </p>

<p> Against Jynx your ideas will be something like this: TWave the Jynx and don't twave anything else early on (yes Tauros is a bitch of a mon to deal with if you can't twave it, tough luck), force your opponent into recovery moves with their Chansey or Snorlax using your own Chansey or Snorlax, and then go Eggy on the recovery turns - win enough sleep vs damage mindgames and you might just manage to bulldoze through their Jynx which will be a great advantage at that point. The match up is good because Jynx is pretty crappy against Normal-type moves but it's not straightforward at all because you will need to play very sharply to punish her. </p>

<p> Against non-Jynx, given how much you have to avoid paralyzing anything early on, Ice spamming is a powerful option to navigate the early game. Lead BlizzMie and click it on the (potential) incoming Chanseys, when in doubt go to your Chansey and hope for some Ice Beam magic, etc. It reads (and feels) like you're just fishing hard, but it is objectively a good idea with solid odds of working out when you're playing Eggy. You're waiting for a turn where their Chansey or Lax is forced into a recovery move and your Eggy can come in freely; where you can find it depends heavily on how the opponent plays, so it's hard to give specific plans, but your Snorlax tends to be very good at creating those sorts of turns. Your build NEEDS to be armed for an early game without Thunder Waves; bringing TBolt on your Chansey to make sure you can force Starmie out is probably the most important thing here, but there's also special attention that should be paid to making sure Lax and Tauros don't run you over. Twaving something early on is okay if 'something' isn't a Chansey, but even if you're just trying to twave a Lax they could easily call it and go Chansey, so it's rough. </p>

<p> A notable gamble you can play (would only recommend vs Alakazam leads though) is going to Exeggutor on turn 1. If you catch a Sing Chansey coming in you flip the match up on its head and it's suddenly very good for you; switching into a Starmie Blizzard is instantly game-losing though, so make sure you only do this when you're against the less dangerous Alakazam (Thunder Wave into Seismic Tosses is pretty bad, especially if you get unlucky, but it's rarer nowadays and switching into Psychic is perfectly fine), or when you're absolutely certain that the enemy Starmie isn't using Blizzard on turn 1. </p>

<h2 id="chansey"> Chansey </h2>

<img src="images/sprites/chansey.png">

<p> Probably the most straightforward one, just go Chansey t1 and click the sleep move. That's it against every team that leads a TWaver. You can actually delay the switch a bit by tossing out random attacks to scout for switchbacks, which probably isn't a bad idea at all given that people are starting to catch onto the turn 1 Chansey trend, but then you're risking your lead getting paralyzed which can suck big time, especially in certain match ups, so be careful. Most of the decisions in the opening lines with Sing Chansey are heavily reliant on prediction or guessing; it's not a bad idea to scout your opponent for specific trends in the first turns if you're choosing to play this structure. </p>

<p> Against Jynx, remember that paralyzing her is super awful if your Chansey isn't Seismic Toss (and it generally won't be) and you should be fine - it's a bit of a crappy match up but you have no better line than sleepsacking and immediately going Chansey to trade it back, hoping you don't get frozen. Staying in after the Lovely Kiss to fish for an early wake is not bad because it takes away risk of being frozen, but you need to be a little cautious of enemy Tauros - it's definitely a line you can play if you have something like a Cloyster at the ready though. </p>

<h1 id="hey"> Hey, but what about some slightly obscure structure or line? </h1>

<p> You're right, there's a lot of viable stuff that this guide doesn't touch on. Gengars, double sleeper builds (specifically the "paralyze something, boom it with eggy, send in the backup sleeper to sleep for real this time" variations), crack wrap HOs, etc. I don't mention them because they tend to be slight variations on one of the main themes that I already cover (and if they're not, they're so far out there that they'd deserve their own standalone guide). There's certainly a number of good openings and team structure ideas that I don't cover here, but this is already pretty long and I just wanted to talk about the core archetypes that are most common at the moment in an accurate but digestible format. They'll be included if I were to write a book on RBY openings, but when it's just a smogon post or 2k20 guide, I'm afraid they have to be cut.< </p>

<h1 id="conclusion"> Final Thoughts </h1>

<p> I hope you learned something from this guide and can walk away with a more complete understanding of the tier, and specifically of the team structures built around sleep in the tier. If you have any questions or feedback I'm happy to hear them. I have my own meta takes (e.g. eggy sucks, never play eggy) but I tried to keep the guide as objective and descriptive as possible. <br> </p>

<h1 class="title">Les débuts de partie en première génération</h1>
<div id="toc"></div>
<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1> 

<p>Depuis le changement de la mécanique de l’attaque Plaquage (Plaquage ne peut plus paralyser de Pokémons de type Normal. Cette mécanique est aussi appelée « paraslam »), le metagame a énormément évolué ; tout particulièrement la façon d’utiliser les attaques de statuts a drastiquement changée. Ce guide essaye de vous dépeindre au mieux la situation actuelle, en mettant en évidence les principales structures d’équipe et les stratégies classiques de début de partie du metagame post-paraslam.</p>  

<p>Ce guide cible les joueurs de niveau intermédiaire, mais même les meilleurs joueurs peuvent y trouver leur compte. Beaucoup des choses dites ici sont probablement hors de portée des nouveaux joueurs : en effet, ce guide suppose que le lecteur a une large connaissance de ce dont chaque Pokémon est capable.</p> 

<h1 id="big4">2016-2018 : cliquer Cage Eclair tour 1 et le metagame du « big 4 »</h1>

<p>Quand on a découvert que Plaquage ne pouvait pas paralyser les Pokémons de type Normal, la première structure d'équipe solide qui dominait le tiers, comportait un lead (Alakazam ou Staross), le « big 4 » (Ronflex, Tauros, Leveinard et Noadkoko), et un dernier Pokémon flexible. Paralyser le lead ennemi permettait à presque tous vos autre Pokémons de le battre ultérieurement. Les joueurs étaient aussi satisfaits de laisser leur lead se faire paralyser, puisque cela leur permettait de bloquer les attaques de sommeil venant notamment de Noadkoko, qui était considéré comme le meilleur utilisateur de ces attaques grâce à sa capacité à pressuriser les Ronflex avec Protection et Repos. Les joueurs hésitaient aussi à abandonner Noadkoko à cause de sa capacité unique à venir sur Rhinoféros sans trop souffrir, ce qu’aucun autre Pokémon dans le tiers ne peut faire aussi bien.</p>

<p>Les structures alternatives existaient mais aucune n’était vraiment fructueuse. Lipoutou était présent mais peu puissant ; il pouvait endormir l’adversaire rapidement, mais il était un mauvais bloqueur de sommeil à cause de l’existence de Noadkoko avec Damoclès ou Ultra Laser. Les équipes avec Noadkoko réussissaient souvent à invalider Lipoutou avec des attaques Normal et un deuxième Pokémon avec poudre Dodo une fois que Lipoutou ne pouvait plus bloquer les attaques de sommeil. Les utilisateurs de Lipoutou se retrouvaient alors avec un large désavantage. Quand cela ne se produisait pas, les utilisateurs de Lipoutou étaient généralement en bonne posture, mais les taux de victoire ont montré que le match up était globalement en faveur de Noadkoko.</p> 

<p>Pendant longtemps, personne n’a trouvé de réponse à ce métagame. Tous les utilisateurs d’attaque de sommeil qui ne s’appelaient pas Noadkoko étaient surclassés par ce dernier. Bien des joueurs ont essayé d’innover, sans succès… jusqu’à ce que les utilisateurs de Ligotage se réveillent.</p> 

<h1 id="victreebel">2018-2019 : Empiflore nous fait tous regretter le jour de notre naissance</h1>

<p>À un moment, les joueurs ont réalisé que Empiflore était capable de prendre le contrôle de la partie face aux structures classiques basées sur le « big 4 ». Étant donné que tout le monde laissait leur lead se faire paralyser, et que Leveinard/Ronflex/Noadkoko sont plus lents que la plante démoniaque, la plupart des équipes n’avaient pas beaucoup d’options face à Ligotage et Poudre Dodo. Les deux derniers Pokémons adverses sont Tauros, un Pokémon qui peut vaincre Empiflore, mais qui n’aime pas prendre des petits dégâts, et un Pokémon flexible qui détermine le match up de Empiflore : des Pokémons anti-Emplifore comme Elector et Alakazam existaient, mais il était aussi commun de voir Rhinoféros ; Locklass et Staross, qui ne peuvent pas venir sur Empiflore.</p>

<p>Dédicace spéciale à FOMG qui a spammé Empiflore à haut niveau et qui a ainsi consolidé sa viabilité. Il a développé l’archétype autour d'Empiflore, l’accompagnant souvent de Rhinoféros pour gérer Electhor, et il est incontestablement l’homme qui a fait passer Empiflore « d’un truc que tu peux ramener par moment » à « un truc que tu peux ramener à chaque partie, et c’est à l’adversaire de se débrouiller pour le battre ».</p>

<p>Avec la montée en puissance d'Empiflore, on avait enfin trouvé un utilisateur de Poudre Dodo aussi fort que Noadkoko. Les joueurs de Noadkoko souffrent et en ont marre d’être 6-0 par Empiflore alors qu’ils jouent Starmie + Big 4 + Rhinoféros. Maudissant la dégénérescence des RBYeurs modernes, ils ont commencé à chercher des contre-mesures, et ils ont trouvé.</p>

<h1 id="sing">2019-2020 : Leveinard avec Berceuse pour absorber la Cage Eclair tour 1</h1> 

<p>Envoyer Leveinard sur une Cage Eclair au premier tour a toujours été une ligne mineure, jouée depuis 2016 et les joueurs y étaient préparés. Ne pas laisser le lead se faire paralyser était fort, et Leveinard est moins susceptible que les leads de type psy d’être vaincu par Noadkoko. Cenpendant, les Leveinard paralysés peuvent être battu par des Psycho Stabés grâce aux coups critiques et aux baisses de spécial.</p>

<p>Pourtant, pour battre Empiflore, l’idée d’avoir un type psy rapide et non-paralysé semble attrayante, et les joueurs ont commencé à jouer de plus en plus de cette manière. Finalement, il a été découvert que si Leveinard embarquait Berceuse, il pourra souvent endormir le type psy adverse, avant d’être forcé à sortir du terrain. Ce style de jeu gagnait à la fois contre Empiflore et contre Noadkoko, puisque Leveinard est censé garantir l’endormissement d’un Pokémon adverse, dès le début de la partie (si on exclut les aléas du tiers). A coté de cela, Noadkoko est incapable de battre un Leveinard paralysé et Empiflore ne peut pas passer le lead de type psy non-paralysé. Cette stratégie a gagné en popularité grâce à sa capacité à embêter les structures d'équipe classiques. Toutes les équipes avant avaient de base : un utilisateur d’attaque de sommeil et trois Pokémons de type Normal, ne laissant que deux places libres. Cependant, en mettant l’attaque de sommeil sur Leveinard, il y a maintenant trois places libres dans une équipe, permettant le développement de nouveaux cores. Des Pokémons spécifiques qui ne compresse que peu les rôles sont devenus bien plus viable, car il y avait désormais plus de places pour eux dans une équipe, là où avant, ils avaient du mal à s’en faire une. Grâce à cela, des Pokémons comme Ectoplasma, Crustabri et Voltali sont devenus plus populaires. A l’inverse, les Pokémons qui appréciaient grandement le fait que le lead de type psy soit paralysé tombent en désuétude : les usages de Locklass et d'Empiflore s’effondrent, mais d’autres comme Electhor et Rhinoféros en souffre aussi.</p> 

<p>Les joueurs de Noadkoko se sont aussi adaptés, en ne cliquant plus Cage Eclair au premier tour. En utilisant Psycho ou Blizzard, ils s’assuraient que l’adversaire n’allait pas obtenir de bloqueur de sommeil, et même si parfois, ils perdaient le rythme à cause du Leveinard Berceuse, ils pouvaient encore revenir dans la partie grâce à leur propre utilisateur d’attaque de sommeil. L’issue de la partie restait en faveur du Leveinard Berceuse, qui grâce au fait qu’il pouvait endormir rapidement l’adversaire, lui permettant ainsi de commencer à abuser de la paralysie, mais ça restait jouable pour les deux joueurs.</p>

<p>Cependant, il y a un Pokémon qui attendait depuis longtemps son heure de gloire. Il était temps pour lui de briller :</p> 

<h1 id="jynx">2019-2020 : le retour de Lipoutou</h1>

<p>Le principal problème de Leveinard avec Berceuse, c’est qu’il doit abandonner une attaque utile pour faire de la place à Berceuse. S’il abandonne Cage Eclair, il aura du mal face aux types psy rapides, face à Electhor et face à Tauros ; s’il abandonne Riposte, il est facilement mis sous pression par Ronflex. Leveinard a évidemment besoin d’une attaque offensive : Laser Glace est multitâche. Laser Glace permet de battre les Pokémons faibles au type glace (Rhinoféros notamment) et d’éventuellement geler les Leveinard adverses. En revanche, il est complètement bloqué par les Staross et les types Glace. Frappe Atlas permet de remédier aux problèmes précédents mais Rhinoféros est bien plus menaçant. La configuration la plus commune est Berceuse + Laser Glace + Riposte + E-Coque. Ce dernier set profite énormément à Lipoutou.</p>

<p>Lipoutou est finalement capable de venir sur les attaques de sommeil. Lipoutou peut simplement cliquer Grobisou au premier tour. En plus, avec Blizzard, Lipoutou a de grandes chances de geler un Pokémon adverse avant de se faire lui-même endormir. Son match up contre Noadkoko est toujours inférieur, mais pas injouable, donc en prenant en compte le bon match up qu’il a face aux Leveinard Berceuse, Lipoutou devient une bonne option.</p>

<p>Bien que les équipes comportant un Lipoutou ne laissent pas vraiment trois places libres contrairement aux équipes avec un Leveinard Berceuse, elles peuvent au moins garantir que deux Pokémons ne seront pas paralysés, ce que ne pouvaient pas garantir des équipes avec Noadkoko. En outre, cela permet de choisir des Pokémons comme Voltali, même si des anciens rois du tiers tels que Rhinoféros y ont encore leurs places.</p>

<h1 id="summary">Résumé : un aperçu des débuts de parties les plus courants</h1>

<p>Les lecteurs attentifs et les experts du tiers auront remarqué que les différentes structures présentées précédemment se répondent l’une à l’autre comme lors d’un Pierre-Papier-Ciseaux : aucune n’est totalement au-dessus des deux autres mais chacune a un meilleur match up face à une autre : les équipes classiques avec Noadkoko sont avantagées face aux Lipoutou, Lipoutou est avantagé face aux Leveinard Berceuse, et les Leveinard Berceuse sont avantagés face aux Noadkoko. (Empiflore a totalement disparu du tiers, car il a du mal face à Leveinard Berceuse et Lipoutou). Voici un guide à propos de comment se joue chaque structure. Notez que prédire quoique ce soit avec précision après les premiers tours est incroyablement difficile : les 5ème et 6ème Pokémons de l’équipe influent fortement sur la façon de jouer, les aléas du jeu peuvent bouleverser votre façon de jouer, et le nombre de scénario possible augmente avec le nombre de tours qui passent. Je ne peux pas couvrir toutes les possibilités, mais je peux vous donner une ligne à suivre.</p>

<h2 id="jynx">Lipoutou</h2>

<img src="images/sprites/jynx.png">

<p>Les équipes avec Noadkoko vont vouloir paralyser Lipoutou au plus vite et ensuite le mettre au tapis avec les attaques de type normal de Noadkoko, et enfin endormir un Pokémon adverse une fois que Lipoutou a été mis hors d’état de nuire. Il faut éviter cela en limitant les venues de Noadkoko sur le terrain et en sécurisant un deuxième bloqueur de sommeil.</p> 

<p>Les équipes avec Leveinard Berceuse vont juste laisser un de leurs Pokémons se faire endormir, et essayer d’endormir un adversaire au plus vite. Le joueur de Lipoutou a un petit avantage du au fait que son Blizzard a une chance de geler le Leveinard avant que sa Berceuse ne réussisse, en plus du fait que Lipoutou endormi peut venir assez gratuitement sur Leveinard Berceuse.</p> 

<p>Le joueur qui se retrouve avec un Lipoutou en face a l’avantage de connaître le match up dès le premier tour, puisqu’il sait s’il joue Noadkoko ou Leveinard Berceuse (même si le joueur de Lipoutou pourra le savoir en fonction de comment est joué le premier tour). Le joueur de Leveinard Berceuse + Laser Glace est le seul qui, dans la plupart des cas, ne paralysera pas le Lipoutou au premier tour, simplement pour ne pas donner de bloqueur de sommeil à l’adversaire. Cependant, il n’est pas possible de tirer une parfaite conclusion d’un Cage Eclair tour 1 : les utilisateurs de Noadkoko et de Leveinard Frappe Atlas peuvent tous les deux choisir cette stratégie.</p> 

<p>Si l’adversaire ne fait pas Cage Eclair au premier tour, il faut supposer que Leveinard avec Berceuse va tenter de rentrer sur le terrain pour vous endormir. Il faut alors faire Blizzard, pour maximiser les chances de geler le Leveinard. Cependant si votre Lipoutou se fait paralyser dès le premier tour, cela réduit les chances qu’un Leveinard rentre sur le terrain. L’envoie de Tauros sur le terrain est très puissant : si le Pokémon adverse est resté sur le terrain : vous pouvez taper Placage gratuitement, et si l’adversaire envoie Leveinard, vous pouvez facilement obtenir un bloqueur de sommeil en anticipant une Cage Eclair venant du Leveinard. Ces manœuvres avec Tauros rendent le match up bien plus agréable pour les joueurs de Lipoutou.</p> 

<h2 id="eggy">Noadkoko</h2>

<img src="images/sprites/exeggutor.png">

<p>Bravo, vous avez choisi la ligne la moins simple pour endormir un Pokémon adverse.</p>

<p>Face à Lipoutou, l’idée est de le paralyser au plus vite et ne rien paralyser d’autre en début de partie (oui ça va être dur de gérer Tauros sans pouvoir le paralyser). Ensuite, il faut forcer votre adversaire à se soigner avec son Leveinard ou son Ronflex en utilisant votre propre Ronflex ou Leveinard, pour envoyer gratuitement votre Noadkoko. Enfin il faut gagner le mindgame entre utiliser l’attaque de sommeil et cliquer Damoclès en anticipant Lipoutou. Le match est bon car Lipoutou n’aime pas du tout prendre des attaques de type Normal, mais ce n’est pas simple à concrétiser puisqu’il faut très bien jouer pour prendre l’avantage.</p>

<p>Contre les équipes sans Lipoutou, étant donné combien vous devez éviter de paralyser trop de choses, l’option la plus puissante est souvent de spammer les attaques de type Glace. En envoyant Staross en premier, vous pouvez cliquer Blizzard au premier tour en anticipant l’arrivée de Leveinard sur le terrain. En cas de doute, vous pouvez envoyer votre Leveinard au premier tour, espérer que Laser Glace fasse son travail. Même si cela donne l’impression que vous cherchez la chance, mais objectivement, c’est une idée assez solide et qui marche assez bien quand vous jouez Noadkoko. Ensuite, comme dans le cas précédent, il vous suffit d’attendre que le Leveinard ou Ronflex se soigne pour envoyer Noadkoko. Cela dépend aussi fortement de comment votre adversaire joue, du coup il est difficile d’être plus précis. Souvent Ronflex est le plus à même de forcer ce genre de ligne. Votre équipe doit être préparé pour des débuts de partie sans Cage Eclair. Avoir Tonnerre sur votre Leveinard est probablement la chose la plus importante ici, puisque ça permet de forcer les Staross à s’en aller. Il faut aussi faire attention à ne pas laisser les Ronflex et Tauros venir sur le terrain puisque vous ne pourrez pas utiliser Cage Eclair face à eux. Paralyser quelque chose tôt dans a partie est possible si ce « quelque chose » n’est pas un Leveinard, mais attention aux anticipations adverses : votre adversaire peut facilement voir venir une Cage Eclair et envoyer son Leveinard.</p>

<p>Un coup notable, que vous pouvez éventuellement jouer (je ne recommande que face aux leads Alakazam) est d’envoyer Noadkoko dès le premier tour. Si Leveinard vient sur le terrain, vous prenez l’ascendant sur votre adversaire. Venir sur un Blizzard de Staross vous fait perdre instantanément. Assurez vous donc de venir sur Alakazam qui est un peu moins dangereux (Cage Eclair suivit Frappe Atlas peut être problématique si vous n’êtes pas très chanceux, mais il est plus courant de nos jours que l’adversaire utilise Psycho au premier tour, ce qui est propice à l’envoie de Noadkoko sur le terrain).</p>

<h2 id="chansey">Leveinard</h2>

<img src="images/sprites/chansey.png">

<p>Probablement la stratégie la plus simple : envoyez Leveinard au premier tour et utilisez Berceuse. C’est ce qu’il faut faire face à tous les leads utilisant Cage Eclair. Vous pouvez éventuellement retarder l’envoi de Leveinard en utilisant une attaque au hasard pour voir si l’adversaire va retirer son Pokémon, ce qui n’est pas forcément une mauvaise idée puisque les joueurs envoient plus souvent Leveinard au premier tour, mais vous risquez que votre lead soit paralysé, ce qui peut être délétère à plus long terme. La plupart des décisions que vous prendrez quand vous jouez Leveinard Berceuse dépendent fortement de vos prédictions. Ce n’est définitivement pas une mauvaise idée de tâter le terrain quand vous ne connaissez pas votre adversaire.</p> 

<p>Contre Lipoutou, il ne faut surtout pas le paralyser si votre Leveinard n’a pas Frappe Atlas (et généralement il ne l’a pas). La ligne peut sembler étrange, mais il n’y a pas de meilleure ligne que de laisser votre lead se faire endormir et d’aller sur Leveinard pour endormir un Pokémon adverse à votre tour, en espérant ne pas se faire geler par le Blizzard de Lipoutou. Rester sur le terrain après avoir pris le Grobisou en espérant se réveiller rapidement n’est pas mauvais car il enlève le risque de se faire geler. En revanche, vous prenez le risque que Tauros vienne gratuitement sur le terrain. Cette ligne est jouable si vous avez quelque chose comme Crustabri dans votre équipe, qui peut facilement venir Tauros.</p>

<h1 id="hey">Qu’en est-il des stratégies plus obscures ?</h1>

<p>Il y a en effet beaucoup d’autre stratégies viables que nous n’avons pas abordées. Ectoplasma, les équipes avec deux utilisateurs d’attaques de sommeil (spécialement les « paralyser quelques choses, exploser avec Noadkoko, et envoyer votre dernier « endormisseur » pour endormir pour de vrai »), les hyper-offenses basés sur Etreinte, etc… Je n’en parle pas parce que ce sont des variations des thèmes dont j’ai déjà parlé plus haut (et s’ils en diffèrent drastiquement, ils méritent leur propre guide). Il y a un certain nombre de bons moyens de débuter une partie et de types d’équipe dont je n’ai pas parlés, mais le guide est déjà assez long et il couvre les principaux archétypes du tiers. J’en parlerais sûrement si je devais écrire un livre sur les débuts de partie en RBY OU, mais ce n’est qu’un article Smogon ou un guide du site RBY 2k20.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Derniers mots</h1>

<p>J’espère que vous avez appris quelques choses grâce à ce guide et que vous repartez avec une meilleure compréhension du jeu ainsi que des structures d’équipes construites autour du sommeil. Si vous avez des questions, soyez libres de les poser, je serais content d’y répondre. J’ai mes propres avis (par exemple je ne joue jamais Noadkoko), mais j’ai essayé d’être le plus objectif possible.</p>

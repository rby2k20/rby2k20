<h1 class="title">An Introduction to RBY Balanced Hackmons</h1>
<div id="toc"></div>
<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
<p>
Due to some very heavy advancements in programming, RBY 2k20's PS Server has managed to support Hackmons with much greater versatility than in the past. This is mainly due to my own handiwork, though people like cityscapes were instrumental in overseeing how it worked before. Originally, it lacked L255s, MissingNo., and most of all, supported Cleric Clause. These were, in part, due to limitations. However, these have now been unleashed, allowing us to have a far more accurate—and unique—metagame. With Pokémon able to get any move and buff their stats to new heights, let's see how crazy the metagame has become. 
</p>
<p>
Currently, the ruleset for RBY Balanced Hackmons on RBY 2k20 is as follows:<br>
<b>OHKO Clause: </b>Pokémon cannot bring OHKO moves to a battle. This includes Guillotine, Fissure, and Horn Drill.<br>
<b>Evasion Clause: </b>Players cannot bring Pokémon with Minimize or Double Team to a battle.<br>
<b>Sleep Clause: </b>Only one Pokémon may be put to sleep by the opponent. Self-inflicted sleep through Rest and pre-statused sleep do not count.<br>
<b>Freeze Clause: </b>Only one Pokémon may be frozen per team. Pre-statused freeze does not count.<br>
<b>Move Bans: </b>Wrap, Bind, Clamp, Fire Spin, Dig, and Fly are all banned. Partial trapping moves were banned due to their interactions with Agility causing unbalanced game states, and Dig and Fly were banned due to their interactions with the introduced PAR item we'll go over in a bit.<br>
<b>Pokémon Bans: </b>Mewtwo is banned.<br><br>
 
</p>
<h1 id="cleric">The Removal of Cleric Clause</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<p>
Unlike standard metagames, Cleric Clause is removed in this format. While HP cannot be set at the moment, you can pre-status a Pokémon by giving any of the new PAR, SLP, FRZ, PSN, and BRN "items", which correspond to their respective status. These will status the Pokémon on switch-in before being consumed, thus not affecting gameplay other than for the intended purpose. This opens up many unique strategies and dynamics, with the PSN and BRN "items" being of particular interest.

}
</script>

<p>
Utilizing pre-statused Pokémon makes it far harder to paralyze them, thus making the metagame much more centered around Speed. This also makes Haze a relevant move option, removing the opponent's pre-status and allowing for paralysis, while also resetting stat stages. It's not uncommon to see unstatused Pokémon switch in on Haze to protect from these situations while forcing the Haze user to take chip damage. The metagame is also a bit faster, as the chip damage from poison and burn tends to rack up. However, by KOing a Pokémon, the chip damage can be skipped like Hyper Beam's recharge, which adds some layer of strategy to utilizing the status. Some Pokémon, such as Tauros, may also pass on using pre-status enabling them to win mirror matches. This new dynamic is extremely nuanced with great potential for optimization. 
</p>
 
<h1 id="level">L255s: More power than ever before!</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="display: inline-block;" src="images/sprites/tauros.png">
<img style="display: inline-block;" src="images/sprites/rb/snorlax.png">
</div>
<p>
The addition of L255 Pokémon has made for a slightly bulkier metagame, with Pokémon generally taking a bit less damage. This has also made it so that stat boosting moves like Swords Dance are less common, as not only is the cap 999, it's possible to get overflows should the stat be debuffed, so changing levels, DVs or Stat Exp to not overflow is a valid option for teambuilding. The highest non-HP stat would be Electrode's Speed, at 956 at L255. This level also causes critical hits to do less damage than usual—though still very high—as they overflow as well. 
</p>
 
<h1 id="missingno">MissingNo.'s Unban</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="display: inline-block;" src="images/sprites/missingno.png">
</div>
<p>
Since it can be obtained through hacking, there was no reason to keep MissingNo. banned in the format. To be quite frank, it isn't very good. MissingNo. is the very definition of "slow and frail", possessing 29 base Speed—1 point less than Snorlax—and 0 base Defense. This makes it incredibly easy to even OHKO, often leading it to being considered dead weight. Its sole niche is a STAB Quick Attack, coming off its impressive 136 Base Attack, which will deal some decent damage. Overall though, MissingNo. won't be making many waves from a metagame perspective, but it's certainly a nice novelty. 
</p>
 
<h1 id="newthreats">New Threats</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p>
With the unrestricted movepools, some Pokémon gain in viability. For example, Crabhammer Starmie and Slash Tauros now exist. However, some Pokémon with great stats and poor movepools also gain significant viability, namely Aerodactyl and Scyther. Both of these threats have incredible physical attacking potential, and with STABs now available, they become genuine picks. Aerodactyl can now use Rock Slide and Drill Peck as dual STAB, while Scyther can use Pin Missile, Twineedle, and Drill Peck. With these in hand, they can become threatening sweepers, and will likely be seeing use on many teams as their resident Earthquake immunity.

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
 
<p>
I'm very proud of the work I've done on this metagame in attempts to bring it closer to cartridge. I think RBY Balanced Hackmons has massive potential given its nature; many iconic glitches and the like can be used here. There's still a lot of issues to fix and fine-tune, but generally, the future of it looks very bright.

<h1 class="title">Japan-exclusive Legality - Japanese Pokémon Blue</h1>

<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>

<p>If you ever played Pokémon Red and Blue, you may remember a translation error regarding an "evolving Raichu". That error actually came from a "lost version": Pokémon Blue's Japanese release. I differ between this and the international release with "Blue JP" and "Blue" respectively, which is how I'll refer to them from here on out. So how did this translation error happen? Well, Pokémon Blue's international release is essentially an amalgamation of Pokémon Green and Pokémon Blue JP. You have Green's encounter data, but Blue JP's bug fixes, sprite updates, and most importantly of all: text scripts. They followed this text script to a T, and this is where the problem comes into play. You see, Blue JP's obtainable Pokémon are quite different. In this case, in Blue JP, the same trade script where the Raichu "evolves" is the one where you trade a Kadabra for a Graveler that evolves into Golem, thus the error. Maybe that man we gave the Raichu to wound up getting Gorochu . . . </p>

<p>The reason we didn't get this game is a bit odd. When being imported by Nintendo of America, word on the street is that Pokémon Red and Blue were picked to match the . . . United States flag, apparently? Then, Nintendo of Europe followed suit. Pokémon Green was never imported in the end due to it being essentially too late. Since Pokémon Blue was technically already out, you could say that the differences were just lost in translation or forgotten. In the end, what we got were entirely different games from what Japan got, all the way down to the releases. Pokémon Green and Blue JP were effectively merged.</p>

<p>Pokémon Blue JP's release was also quite weird. My good friend Dr. Lava covered this in <a href=http://lavacutcontent.com/corocoro-comic-pokemon-blue/>an article</a> that I strongly suggest reading, but to summarise, it was released via mail order by CoroCoro Comic for a limited time in 1996. When Pokémon Yellow was released, the developers decided to re-release the game alongside it, effectively making a release akin to Pokémon Black and White 2. If it were not for this re-release, Pokémon Blue JP would have been extremely rare. Should you be interested in playing this "lost version", while you could play the Japanese version, there are fan patches online that change Pokémon Blue's international release into Blue JP. However, this isn't the article to discuss that. Due to the changes Blue JP made, there is Japan-exclusive legality, which is relevant for formats such as Nintendo Cup '97.</p>


<h1 id="trade">In-Game Trades</h1>

<p>Since we were on the subject of in-game trades, let's talk about those first. Pokémon Blue JP's in-game trades were completely changed, and this has some big effects on legality. They were actually amazing, with many of these trades giving you meta-relevant Pokémon such as Tauros and the aforementioned Golem. The intention was to give the trades some "discovery" factor for the player, with two NPCs giving you Pokémon that evolve when traded. Thus, it would encourage players to trade with friends to see what other Pokémon evolve when this happens.</p>

<p>Those who are heavily into the legality factor of Generation I may know that many Pokémon cannot get max DVs. This is due to a combination of overworld encounters and the RNG design not being exactly great. No machine can simulate absolutely true randomness, really, and it shows the most on old hardware and software. While this hasn't been implemented onto the Generation I battle simulators such as Pokémon Showdown, it should be considered. However, in scenarios other than what I have presented, such as in-game trades, max DVs are possible.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<img style="display: inline-block;" src="images/sprites/rb/kangaskhan.png">
<img style="display: inline-block;" src="images/sprites/rb/tauros.png">
</div>
<p>Pokémon Blue JP just so happens to have multiple Pokémon previously affected by the issue as trades: Gengar, Golem, Kangaskhan and Tauros. Due to this, in Japanese Generation I formats, these Pokémon can have legal max DVs, so long as they are obtained in this way. As such, this is huge for these Pokémon when playing on cartridge. These trades would never be seen or referenced again, not even in FireRed and LeafGreen or Let's Go Pikachu and Let's Go Eevee.</p>

<p>Here's a list of the in-game trades available. </p>

<ul>
<li>Should one be playing with max DV incarnations of the aforementioned Pokémon in Japanese formats, it is recommended that these nicknames are used to reveal them.</li>
<li>There is an unused trade for a Beedrill that can theoretically be obtained through glitches. The legitimacy and legality of this can be hotly debated, though, and I am mainly noting it here for completion's sake. Funnily enough though, this was fully translated in the international releases as CHIKUCHIKU.</li>
<li>All Pokemon that evolve when traded in these scenarios cannot have their evolution stopped. However, the Pokédex is updated.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="pika">Pika Cup Applications</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<p>These trades being available makes three new Pokémon eligible for Pika Cup formats: Golem, Muk, and Kangaskhan. These are actually used by the final Fisher in Stadium, which led to allegations of him being a dirty cheat! But, I shall come to his defense. While his Golem is certainly not obtainable, it's possible to get the Kangaskhan and Muk. But, it's also impossible to fight against a Japanese cartridge in any iteration of Generation I, not even Stadium. So, this battle is technically impossible, and the only time an international player can ever fight a Japanese "player".</p>

<p>But, how do you obtain them? It's . . . kind of insane the lengths you have to go for some of them, but here's a step-by-step guide for each.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Golem:</b> Catch an L16 Kadabra and trade it with the man at Cinnabar Lab.</li>
<li><b>Kangaskhan:</b> Catch an L15 Golduck by using Surf on Route 6 (5% encounter), and trade it with Pokémon Yellow. In Pokémon Yellow, trade for the Rhydon at Cinnabar Lab. Once done, trade this Rhydon back to Pokémon Blue JP and trade for the Kangaskhan at Route 11.</li>
<li><b>Muk:</b> Do the above steps to obtain Kangaskhan. Then, trade that Kangaskhan back to Pokémon Yellow and trade for the Muk at Cinnabar Lab.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="pika">Version-exclusive encounters</h1>

<p>There are two Pokémon that can be exclusively caught in Blue JP: Lickitung and Jynx. The only way to obtain these Pokémon in the international games is to trade for MARC and LOLA respectively. Because of this, it is impossible to nickname a Lickitung or Jynx outside of Japan. You can technically abuse an OT with the same ID number, though.</p>

<img style="display: center;" src="images/sprites/rb/lickitung.png">
<p>Lickitung can be found exclusively in the Safari Zone at L25 in the East (4% encounter) or L28 (1% encounter) in the West. Due to the level, unfortunately, these Lickitung do not have Wrap. They come with Supersonic, Stomp, Disable, and Defense Curl. It acts as one of the "big catches" of the area, similar to that of Scyther and Tauros. Due to the nature of the encounter, these Lickitung cannot have max DVs, making them suboptimal to catch and use in competitive RBY. </p>

<img style="display: center;" src="images/sprites/rb/jynx.png">
<p>Jynx can be found exclusively in the Seafoam Islands, replacing Psyduck and Golduck. It can be caught at L37 or L39 depending on the floor you're on, with a 4% encounter rate on those given floors. Due to the level it's obtained at, these Jynx cannot have Pound. An L37 Jynx comes with Lovely Kiss, Lick, Double Slap, and Ice Punch. L39 would replace Lovely Kiss with Body Slam. </p>

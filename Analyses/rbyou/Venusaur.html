<h1>Introduction</h1>
 
<p>Venusaur is both a reliable sleep user and threatening sweeper, thanks to its access to Sleep Powder and Swords Dance, a combination which synergises well by enabling Venusaur to readily create openings to set up. Despite these tools, it is only barely viable in OU, as its typing ensures that most OU staples can hit it super effectively. Furthermore, it lives in the shadow of Victreebel, which is a similar but far more versatile threat thanks to Wrap and Stun Spore. Victreebel's superior power also makes it more effective against Chansey, Alakazam and Jolteon if it's running a similar set. On the other hand, Venusaur's superior physical bulk makes it more effective at switching into Rhydon due to not being 2HKO'd by Earthquake while also allowing it to take stray hits from Snorlax and Tauros better, and its superior speed means that it doesn't have to risk a speed tie against Cloyster and it can incapacitate other Grass type sleep users. Overall, Venusaur's a significant threat if you can compensate for its weaknesses, however one must also be mindful that Victreebel may be a better choice unless care is taken to play to Venusaur's strengths.</p>

<h3>Set Details</h3>
 
<p>
    The goal of this set is generally to put something to sleep, then set up with Swords Dance and tear through the opposing team. Swords Dance is necessary for Venusaur to pose a significant threat. Razor Leaf is a reliable STAB option, and great for chipping enemies into Hyper Beam range or for attacking if you're not ready to set up Swords Dance- it also eviscerates Water and Ground types, notably bypassing Slowbro's Amnesia boosts thanks to it practically always landing a critical hit. Sleep Powder is a generally useful move, but specifically provides Venusaur with openings to set up Swords Dance. Hyper Beam benefits from Swords Dance boosts and is excellent at finishing off weakened foes. It's worth bearing in mind that often the opponent will seek to play around sleep by either absorbing it with something that's of little value or blocking it with a paralysed pokemon- in such cases you may be better off scouting the opponent, or making a risky play and boosting straight away.

<h2>Other Options</h2>
 
<p>
    Body Slam is by far Venusaur's most notable alternate option, as it gives Venusaur a physical attacking option that's a lot safer than Hyper Beam while also having a chance to spread paralysis, however its damage output is rather poor- making Swords Dance less of a sweeping tool and more of a punishment for passive play. Otherwise Venusaur doesn't really have any good alternatives. Double-Edge is a little stronger than Body Slam and at +2 3HKOs Exeggutor and usually 2HKOs Chansey, but it can't paralyse and deals recoil damage instead so it generally isn't a great option.

<h2>Checks and Counters</h2>
 
<p>
    Gengar is a hard counter as it's immune to Venusaur's boosted Normal attacks and resists Razor Leaf, while comfortably defeating Venusaur with Night Shade. Dragonite is another strong check- Venusaur is a prime setup opportunity for Dragonite, as Venusaur cannot reliably paralyse Dragonite, nor can it otherwise prevent Dragonite from setting up Agility. Exeggutor is a solid check since it resists Razor Leaf, has good physical bulk and can retaliate with status and STAB Psychic. All three legendary birds resist Razor Leaf and 2HKO with super effective STAB attacks, while Zapdos also has the option of paralysing. Lastly, Alakazam and Jynx both outspeed Venusaur and 2HKO it with their STAB attacks, however Alakazam has a 74% chance to be KO'd by +2 Hyper Beam, while Jynx is always OHKO'd (assuming no misses).
